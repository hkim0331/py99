## `R99` => `R99c` => `Py99`

In 2017, I programmed `R99` using COMMON LISP.
It was designed for C programming beginners.
Although simple, which is not an online tutorial.
The main purpose of it is to provide mutual stdudying environment to
students. Students can see other students' answers if he/she submitted
his/her answers including teacher's advices on this app.

I planed to rewrite the old `R99` with newly learned language,
Clojure. It was done as `R99c`.

Then in 2022, my university's caliculum changed from C to Python.
Truely said, it was me who insist the language change because teachers had selected languages accroding to their own favorites. C, processing, JavaScript, bash, and so on. It was no good for students.

So, python. In case of me, I love Clojure much more than Python.

With spirit of Clojure's functional programming, benefit of immutable data, I will teach python. For the preparation, first of all, rebuild `R99c` as `Py99`.
